                <hr>
                <p>Earth, our home planet, is the third rock from the Sun and the only known world teeming with life. It boasts diverse ecosystems, from lush rainforests to arid deserts. The planet's surface is 71% water, primarily in oceans. Earth's atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, supports life and shields us from harmful solar radiation. With its dynamic climate and ever-changing landscapes, Earth remains a marvel in the vastness of space.</p>

                <p>
                    Venus is similar in size and structure to Earth but is
                    shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid,
                    creating a runaway greenhouse effect. This makes
                    it the hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is often visible just before sunrise or after sunset, earning it the name "The Morning Star."

                    <p>
                        Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. It's named after the Roman messenger god and zips around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Despite being so close to the Sun, Mercury has no atmosphere to retain heat, making its temperature fluctuate drastically.

                        Mars is known for its reddish appearance, which comes from iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. Mars has the tallest volcano and the deepest canyon in our solar system. It's a prime candidate for future human exploration due to evidence of ancient water flows.

                        Uranus has a bluish color due to methane in its atmosphere and is unique because it rotates on its side. Its axial tilt of 98 degrees means it has extreme seasons. Uranus is surrounded by a faint ring system and has 27 known moons.

                <p>
                    The Vostok 1 mission, launched on April 12, 1961, marked the first time humans ventured into space. The spacecraft completed a full orbit of the Earth in approximately 108 minutes. It demonstrated the Soviet Union's advanced capabilities in space technology, setting a significant milestone in the space race. The success of Vostok 1 was a testament to the potential of human ingenuity and engineering. This mission opened the doors to future space exploration, inspiring generations to look beyond our planet.
